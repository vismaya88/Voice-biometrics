This dataset is divided into two main sub-datasets: samePhrase and differentPhrase. Each speaker has the same label in both sub-datasets. In the samePhrase sub-dataset, a speaker repeats the sentence “Machine Learning 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10” ten times. The length of each sample is between seven and ten seconds. For the differentPhrase sub-dataset, each speaker contributed with a phrase selected randomly from different resources such as books, song's lyrics, or online texts. Each speaker contributed with ten different samples, the length of each sample in the differentPhrase sub-dataset does not exceed ten seconds. Table 1 shows in detail the division of the dataset. Empty Cell	Empty Cell	Number of Speakers	Empty Cell
Subsets	Number of Samples	Female	Male	Data Duration
samePhrase	1500	96	54	2.9 h
differentPhrase	1500	96	54	3.1 h
TOTAL	3000	150	6 h
In both the samePhrase and differentPhrase sub-datasets, there are 150 directories labeled from 1 to 150 that corresponds to the speaker who contributed to the dataset. Each directory holds ten voice samples for each speaker. The naming convention for each sample follows “Speaker Label - Sample Number” format. For example, “3–4.flac” refers to the 4th voice sample provided by the 3rd speaker. For the samePhrase sub-dataset, the samples are numbered from one to ten for each speaker. While for the differentPhrase sub-dataset, the samples are numbered from 11 to 20 for each speaker. Each speaker participating in the data collection process was asked to record 20 voice samples. Out of the 20 samples, ten samples represent the phrase “Machine Learning, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10” which are included in the samePhrase sub-dataset. As for the remaining ten samples, the choice was left for the speaker to select the phrases they wish to say. These samples are included in the differentPhrase sub-dataset.
