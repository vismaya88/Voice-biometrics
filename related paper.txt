Voice recognition has attracted scientists as an important domain and has created a technological impact on society that is expected to grow in this area of human-machine interaction. In this research, we tried to summarize the machine learning practices in the field of voice recognition. We described the basic principles, methods, and analysis of issues that voice recognition faces. MFCC is calculated as features to characterize audio content. A comparison of the performance of each of these models was created. In terms of recognition accuracy, the SVM model outperformed the RF model.
